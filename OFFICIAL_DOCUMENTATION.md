# 📘 Codex-IA: Official Documentation (v20.0)

**The World's First Autonomous AI-Driven IDE.**

Codex-IA is not just a code editor. It is an **Autonomous Software Firm** that lives on your desktop and connects to a global Hive Mind. It replaces the traditional "Editor + Terminal + StackOverflow" workflow with a "CEO + Workforce" workflow.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. The Autonomous IDE (`CodexIDE.exe`)
*   **Zero-UI Config:** No complicated settings. Just open the folder.
*   **Context-Aware:** Reads your entire project structure, `.env`, and dependencies automatically.
*   **Natural Language Coding:** You verify logic; Codex writes syntax.

### 2. The Agent Swarm (Cloud-Connected)
Codex-IA connects to the **PythonJet Cloud Core** to access advanced agents:

| Agent Name | Function | Capability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Hunter** | 🕵️‍♂️ Trend Scout | Scans the internet for high-value business opportunities and suggests projects. |
| **Legal Eagle** | ⚖️ Auto-Lawyer | Generates LGPD/GDPR compliant Privacy Policies and ToS based on *actual code analysis*. |
| **The Swarm** | 🐝 Hive Mind | Shares bug fixes across all global instances. If one user fixes a bug, *everyone* learns. |
| **The Oracle** | 🔮 Infinite Memory | A Vector Database (RAG) that ingests massive documentation to answer "impossible" questions. |

### 3. Project Lazarus (IoT Bridge)
*   **Physical Control:** Allows code to control real-world objects (Lights, Doors, Alarms).
*   **Firmware Gen:** Automatically writes C++ code for ESP32/Arduino to connect new hardware to the Codex Network.

### 4. Mind Free (Accessibility)
*   **No-Hands Control:** A webcam-based interface allowing finding tetraplegic users to control the system using **Face Mesh** technology (Head movements + Blinking).
*   **Social Impact:** Designed to democratize technology access for the 15% of the population with disabilities.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Installation
1.  Download `CodexIDE.exe` (Dist folder).
2.  Run the executable.
3.  (Optional) Place your `.env` file in the same folder for cloud connectivity.

### Basic Workflow
1.  **Open Project:** Select your local folder.
2.  **Chat:** Ask Codex: *"Refactor this file to use AsyncIO"* or *"Create a landing page for a Pet Shop"*.
3.  **Missions:** Go to the "Missions" tab to start a multi-step Agent task (e.g., "Build an E-commerce").

### Advanced Workflow (Cloud)
1.  **Access The Hunter:** Click the Radar icon to find profitable Niches.
2.  **Access The Swarm:** Click the Hive icon to sync your brain with the global network.

## 🛡️ Security & Ethics
*   **Human-on-the-Throne:** The AI suggests; YOU decide.
*   **Evolution:** The system can propose improvements to its own code (`evolution_agent.py`), but cannot apply them without authorization.
*   **Local-First:** Your code stays local unless you explicitly deploy to PythonJet Cloud.
