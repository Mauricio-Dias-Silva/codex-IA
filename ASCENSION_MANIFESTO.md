# CODEX-IA: THE ASCENSION MANIFESTO
> "The code that writes itself."

## 1. Project Overview
Codex-IA is an advanced, agentic AI coding environment designed to evolve autonomously. It combines a modern Electron/React desktop interface with a powerful Python-based AI brain (`CodexAgent`), capable of executing complex missions, self-improving via "Night Shift", and integrating with the PythonJet ecosystem.

### Current Version: 2.0.0 (Ascension Phase)

## 2. Architecture

### The Trinity
The system is composed of three main pillars:

1.  **The Interface (Frontend)**
    *   **Tech:** Electron, React, Vite, TailwindCSS, Monaco Editor.
    *   **Role:** Provides a VS Code-like experience, manages project state, and visualizes AI operations.
    *   **Communication:** Communicates with the backend via IPC (Inter-Process Communication) over stdin/stdout.

2.  **The Brain (Backend)**
    *   **Tech:** Python 3.11+, LangChain, Google Gemini Pro.
    *   **Role:** Hosts the `CodexAgent`, `SquadLeader` (Level 8), and `EvolutionAgent` (Level 5/9).
    *   **Key Components:**
        *   `app.py`: The bridge between Electron and Python.
        *   `codex_ia.core.agent`: The central intelligence.
        *   `codex_ia.core.squad`: Orchestrates multi-agent missions (Coder, Tester, Researcher).

3.  **The Cloud (PythonJet)**
    *   **Role:** Deployment target and verification platform.
    *   **Integration:** Codex-IA can deploy projects directly to PythonJet (Cloud Run).

| **Lvl 5** | The Night Shift | ✅ | Autonomous background improvement cycles. |
| **Lvl 6** | The Vision | ✅ | Ability to "see" UI (Multimodal capabilities). |
| **Lvl 7** | The Network | ✅ | Shared wisdom database across projects. |
| **Lvl 8** | The Squad | ✅ | Multi-agent collaboration (Leader + Specialists). |
| **Lvl 9** | The Product Manager | 🚧 | Backlog generation and prioritization. |
| **Lvl 10** | The Founder | 🚧 | Business idea generation and landing pages. |

## 4. Key Features

### 🚀 Squad Missions
Dispatch complex instructions to a team of agents.
*   *Example:* "Refactor the authentication module to use JWT and write tests for it."
*   **Squad:** The Leader plans, the Coder implements, the Tester verifies.

### 🌙 Night Shift v1
Autonomous self-maintenance.
*   **Action:** Scans the codebase for TODOs, linting errors, and missing docstrings.
*   **Result:** Automatically applies fixes while the user is away.

### 🖥️ Desktop Experience
*   **Native App:** fast, responsive, and works offline (mostly).
*   **Monaco Editor:** Industry-standard code editing experience.
*   **File Explorer:** Integrated file management.

## 5. Deployment & Setup

### Building the Executable
1.  Navigate to `codex-desktop-v2`.
2.  Run `npm install`.
3.  Run `npm run build` (Build React).
4.  Run `npm run dist` (Package Electron).
5.  Find executable in `dist/win-unpacked/Codex-IA.exe`.

### Python Requirements
The app requires a local Python environment with:
*   `langchain`, `google-genai`, `chromadb`, etc.
*   Dependencies listed in `codex_ia/requirements.txt`.

## 6. Future Roadmap (Levels 11-13)

*   **Level 11 (Immunity):** Runtime self-protection and proactive bug patching.
*   **Level 12 (Singularity):** Recursive self-improvement (AI rewriting its own core logic).
*   **Level 13 (God Mode):** Complete autonomy over infrastructure and revenue generation.

> "The goal is not just to code, but to create a coder that codes better than we do."
